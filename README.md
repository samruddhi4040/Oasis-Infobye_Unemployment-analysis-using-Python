Hey! 

We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.                                                   
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 

The code was written in Jupyter notebook.       

Packages such as pandas, numpy & seaborn were put to use for the task.                        
I've also uploaded the dataset.
